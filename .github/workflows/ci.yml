name: CI Pipeline

# Step 1: Trigger on push to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# Step 2: Give this workflow permission to upload a build artifact
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
  packages: write

# Step 3: Define the jobs
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    # This job will run on a fresh Ubuntu machine provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 4: Checkout (download) your code from the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 5: Set up the correct version of Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use the version that matches your project

      # Step 6: Install your project dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'ci' is for clean, reproducible installs vs. 'install'

      # Step 7: Run your tests (Your script currently just echoes a message)
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 8: "Build" the project (For Node.js, this often just means preparing the files)
      # Since your app doesn't need a complex build, we just list the files.
      - name: Build Project (List files)
        run: ls -la

      # Step 9: Create a ZIP file of the essential code to deploy
      - name: Create Deployment Package
        run: zip -r my-app.zip . -x '*.git*' 'node_modules/*'

      # Step 10: Upload the ZIP file as a build artifact
      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: node-app-package
          path: my-app.zip
